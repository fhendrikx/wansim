WANsim was written on an [http://www.ubuntu.com Ubuntu] Linux server. Some of the documentation on this site assumes that this is the case. 

However, WANsim should work correctly on any Linux server if you have some basic knowledge of Unix/Linux administration. Recent changes to the wansim init.d script have made it more resilient on non-Debian platforms.

WANsim requires the following:

  * Standard PC or server with at least 2 NICs (network cards) for bridged mode
  * Linux installed (with a recent 2.6 Linux kernel)

The following packages are required:

  * bash
  * bridge-utils
  * iproute
  * net-tools

The following packages are optional (but useful):

  * sudoers

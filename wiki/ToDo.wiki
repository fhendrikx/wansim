= TODO =

The following is my TODO list. If anyone has any other suggestions, please let me know.


=== WANsim ===

  * Consider: Packet re-ordering support. Not sure if this is really needed because setting a large jitter value will cause packets to be send out of order. See [http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/Net:Netem#Packet_re-ordering] for more information.


=== WANsim setup ===

  * Add: Show/Hide the (r)estart option if sudoers is/is not available
  * Add: Resilience to wansim setup script (allow alternative init.d invoke methods)


=== WANsim packaging ===

  * Fix: Generic install script enhancements.


=== Other ===

  * Fix: Test package on other platforms (e.g. Voyager)

*Why did you call it WANsim?*

I wanted a simple, easy to remember name. Obviously it needed to feature the word *WAN*. Simulation came about because I was simulating a real WAN. Of course, the term I should really have used is _emulation_. 

Oh well, it's too late now.


*Why write the whole thing as a bash script?*

Why not? I could have used Perl, but bash is more widely available, especially on resource limited boxes.


*How do I set my interfaces to _insert settings here_?*

Simply edit `/var/lib/wansim/interfaces.conf` and set the two interfaces to what you require. You will also need to make `SETINTS=1`. These interface settings will be applied at every boot. Settings `SETINTS=0` will leave the interfaces unchanged. This is the default behaviour.

== General ==

*Why did you call it WANsim?*

I wanted a simple, easy to remember name. Obviously it needed to feature the word *WAN*. Simulation came about because I was simulating a real WAN. Of course, the term I should really have used is _emulation_. 

Unfortunately, it's a little late to change it now.


== Software ==

*Why write the whole thing as a bash script?*

Why not? I could have used Perl, but bash is more widely available, especially on resource limited boxes.


*What kernel do I need?*

You need a relatively recent Linux kernel. Any 2.6+ Linux kernel should do the trick.


*What modules do I need to enable/compile in my kernel?*

You will need:
  * 802.1d Ethernet Bridging module
  * Network Emulation module (it's under QoS/Fair Queuing)


*Do I need to configure my interfaces?*

No, WANsim will take care of configuring your interfaces and the bridge. If your interfaces require special modules to be loaded, you will still need to ensure that these are loaded.


*Do I really need sudoers installed?*

Strictly speaking you don't actually need sudoers to be installed. However, the WANsim interface offers an option that allows you to restart the WANsim init.d script. For this to work, you need to be able to run init.d scripts. This can be done via either sudoers (my preferred option) or changing the permissions bits on the script (a potential security hole).


*What's the default password for the wansim user?*

There isn't one. You need to set the password for the wansim user after you've installed the package. Use the UNIX passwd command to do that. 


== Hardware ==

*What network cards can I use with WANsim?*

You should be able to use any standard network card that can be put into _promiscuous mode_. This will unfortunately rule out many wireless network cards as they don't interact nicely with the kernel bridging code (it requires promiscuous mode).


*How do I set my interfaces to 10/100/1000, Half/Full Duplex, etc?*

_WANsim 1.4-1 and above_

Simply create and edit `/var/lib/wansim/interfaces.conf` and set the two interfaces to what you require. These interface settings will be applied at every boot by the wansim init.d script. Simply deleting the file ensures that the settings are no longer applied.

_WANsim 1.3-2 and below_

Simply edit `/var/lib/wansim/interfaces.conf` and set the two interfaces to what you require. You will also need to make `SETINTS=1`. These interface settings will be applied at every boot by the wansim init.d script. Setting `SETINTS=0` will leave the interfaces unchanged. This is the default behaviour.


*What is the maximum emulated network speed you can achieve?*

On a low end P4 I was able to achieve a 15Mbit throughput. I'm certain you'll get better results on more powerful hardware.

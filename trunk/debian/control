Description: This package provides a simple, inline bridge that allows 
 you to emulate a WAN connection. Simply ensure that your Linux box 
 has 2 NICs and place it between your "local" and "remote" locations.
 WANsim allows you to change the WAN speed (in kbit/s) and the latency 
 (in ms) of the data passing over the emulated WAN connection. WANsim
 will also allow you to introduce errors (such as packet corruption,
 loss and duplication).

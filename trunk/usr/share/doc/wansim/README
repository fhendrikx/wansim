INTRODUCTION

WANsim is a simple, inline bridge that allows you to simulate a WAN
connection. Simply ensure that your Linux box has 2 NICs and place
it between your "local" and "remote" centres.

 Local -----| WANsim |----- Remote
            +--------+

WANsim allows you to change the WAN speed (in kbit/s) and the latency 
(in ms) of the data passing over the simulated WAN connection. WANsim
will also allow you to introduce errors (such as packet corruption,
loss and duplication).

WANsim uses the Linux NETEM functionality to accomplish its goals. It
was developed on an Ubuntu Linux system. It is highly recommend that 
you use Linux Kernel 2.6.22 or later.


USAGE

Please install WANsim on your computer as detailed in the INSTALL
document.

Once installed, you can login as "wansim" and change the simulated
WAN settings using the menu.

Your simulated WAN will be automatically started at boot time.


HISTORY

WANsim was developed for my own testing purposes. It initially started 
life as a simple script that was called at boot time. Configurable
features were added over time and finally the menu system was added.

Some features were added purely for this public release. Please let me
know if you have any problems, fixes or patches.
